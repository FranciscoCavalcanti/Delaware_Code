# Delaware_Code

This repository aims  to collect, manipulate, and generate variables related to climatic shocks on AMC (Comparable Minimum Areas) in Brazilian territory.
The following tasks will be implemented.

* Collect data at 0.5 grid level regarding weather data from [University of Delaware Air Temperature & Precipitation](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.UDel_AirT_Precip.html#detail "Willmott, C. J. and K. Matsuura (2001) Terrestrial Air Temperature and Precipitation: Monthly and Annual Time Series University of Delaware Air Temperature & Precipitation").
* Collect data from Brazilian maps defining the geographical boundaries of the AMC from [Ehrl, Philipp (2017) Minimum Comparable Areas (AMC)](https://sites.google.com/site/philippehrl/research "Ehrl, Philipp (2017) Minimum comparable areas for the period 1872-2010: an aggregation of Brazilian municipalities").
* Combine grids within areas, generate statistics, and build historical data.
* Collapse historical data as panel data at the quarterly frequency and at AMC level.
